# pca-workshop
The aim of the workshop is to illustrate methods we can use to assess convergence and sampling in MD trajectories. You will compare and contrast the most basic and widely-used method to do this - RMSD analysis - with the use of more sophisticated approaches based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 

You will apply the approaches to two common scenarios: firstly the comparison of the dynamics of a protein the presence and absence of a bound ligand, and secondly the evaluation of sampling and convergence in an ensemble of independent, replicate, MD trajectories of a protein.

## Reqirements
A basic knowledge of Python and MD analysis methods.

## Training material
A Jupyter notebook and associated data files.
